        <br> [Verse 1] </br>
        <p> All we needed was love and then we killed that </p>
        <p> All we needed was trust and then we broke that </p>
        <p> All we needed was us and then we both thought </p>
        <p> That maybe it wasn't enough </p>
        <p> Things are not the same, I know we both changed </p>
        <p> What was once familiar now is so strange </p>
        <p> This is something we could never maintain </p>
        <p> Maybe it's never enough </p>
        <br> [Chorus] </br>
        <p> Arguments when we talk </p>
        <p> Left us both in the dark </p>
        <p> I just don't know where to start </p>
        <p> All we needed was love </p>
        <p> All we needed was love </p>
        <p> All we needed was that precious little bullet wound </p>
        <p> All we needed was love </p>
        <p> All we needed was love </p>
        <p> All we needed was that precious little bullet wound </p>
        <br> [Verse 2] </br>
        <p> So head over heels until we both fell </p>
        <p> What we had was real in case you can't tell </p>
        <p> Can't control how I feel, but maybe it just wasn't enough </p>
        <p> Thought it was love but then I don't know </p>
        <p> Or whatever it was, guess it don't show </p>
        <p> Maybe that's the way that everything was never enough </p>
        <br> [Chorus] </br>
        <br> [Bridge] </br>
        <p> I didn't mean to make you cry </p>
        <p> Baby I apologize </p>
        <p> I'm not that kind of guy </p>
        <br> [Chorus] </br>
